# Phases
**Basic db functionality**
- Query the database
- Add files
- Add tags

**Minimal API** (FLASK)
Make a API call for every action in the backend, backend only responds to requests

**Very simple Frontend**
- TUI or very simple HTML that can interact with backend via API
- Display files in database, remove and rename files

**Increase functionality complexity**
Now with a very basic architecture that is testable, start adding more core functionality:
- Move and create files. 



# Tasks
- GUI that displays current files, applies filters, and search
- API in FLASK to request actions from the backend
